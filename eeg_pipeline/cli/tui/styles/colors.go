// Theme: Monochrome Research Terminal.
// Pure grayscale palette. All emphasis is communicated through weight (bold
// vs. regular) and value (bright vs. dim), never hue. The only colored tones
// are reserved for semantically critical states that would be unsafe to
// convey through typography alone — Warning (amber) and Error (muted red).
// Everything else — Primary/Accent/Success/Info — resolves to grayscale,
// deliberately neutralizing the previous steel-blue accent.

	// "Primary" is the brightest foreground; used with Bold to mark focus
	// and active selection. Selection is recognized by weight, not hue.

	// clinical, research-grade feel than the previous warm near-white.

	// and Muted so accented values feel deliberate without shouting.

	// Success resolves to the same bright off-white as Primary: meaning is
	// carried by the ✓ mark, not by color.

	// monochrome contexts and for users with custom palettes — tuned to
	// feel considered rather than alarming.
